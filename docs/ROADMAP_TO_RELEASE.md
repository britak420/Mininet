# The road to release

**Status: no release date is set, and none should be inferred from this
document.** Most of what remains is not code — it is external audit, legal
review, real hardware, and one open research question nobody has solved. Those
close when an outside party actually does the work, not when engineering
finishes preparing for them. A roadmap that promised a date would be the first
dishonest thing in this repository.

What this document *is*: the single ordered account of what stands between
today and a public release that real people can trust with real money, real
identity, and real speech. Every item says what it is, why it blocks release,
what would actually close it, and who can close it. Nothing here is closed by
writing more Rust unless the "Closed by" line says so.

This file is the detail. The [README](../README.md#the-road-to-release) carries
the summary, and the two are kept consistent by `tools/check_roadmap.py`, which
fails CI if they drift.

## How to read the status marks

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `done` | Closed. Cites the D-number or merged PR that closed it. |
| `active` | Being worked now. |
| `ready` | Nothing blocks starting it; nobody has. |
| `blocked` | Waits on another row, named in `Blocked by`. |
| `outside` | **Cannot be closed by this repository.** Needs an auditor, counsel, a researcher, real hardware, or a founder decision. |

`outside` is the important one. Six of the rows below are `outside`, and they
include the largest gate of all. Engineering's job for those is to prepare the
scope package under [`docs/gates/`](gates/) and then stop — never to quietly
downgrade a gate into something code can satisfy.

## Rule for keeping this current

A pull request that advances or closes a roadmap item **updates its row in the
same pull request**, with the D-number or PR that justifies the change. Not
afterwards, not in a follow-up. A roadmap updated in arrears is a roadmap that
describes the past.

`tools/check_roadmap.py` enforces what it can mechanically: every row has a
valid status, every `done` row cites a decision that actually exists in
`docs/DECISION_LOG.md`, every `blocked` row names a row that exists, and the
README's summary counts match this file. It cannot check that a row is
*honest*; that stays a review question.

# Phase 1 — Get the tree trustworthy again

Small, unglamorous, and first, because everything downstream is measured by
CI and by the governance validators. While these are red, no other claim in
this repository can be checked cheaply.

### R1 — Governance validator reads data, not commentary · `done`
The exceptions scan counted a commented-out template example as a live
governance exception, turning `governance-policy` on `main` red and
`canonical-governance` red on every open pull request. Also gave that check
its first tests in either direction.
**Closed by:** D-0452 / PR #309, merged 2026-09-04. `governance-policy` on
`main` is green again on the two merge commits since, and the validator suite
passes there (111 tests).

### R2 — A green, meaningful CI baseline on `main` · `done`
A **scheduled** run has now passed end to end on `main`, which is what this
row actually named — push-triggered green was never sufficient, because the
scheduled run is what caught both prior failures days after a merge.
**Closed by:** D-0461. Scheduled `ci` run 860 (2026-09-05 08:22 UTC) passed on
head `01ad0ce`, and every other workflow is green on that same head:
`governance-policy` 734, `reproducibility` 636, `android-ci` 505,
`android-reproducibility` 496, and CodeQL's default-setup "Push on main" 904.
`governance-canonical` has no run on that head **by design** — it triggers on
`pull_request_target`, so it only ever runs against pull requests; it was green
on #313, #314 and #316.
**The surviving exception, recorded rather than tolerated:** `dependency-audit`
reports advisories without gating (D-0441/D-0450). That is a deliberate,
already-decided split — the scanner failing to *run* is a hard failure, while
an advisory against a pinned dependency is a loud warning — and it stays a
warning until this workspace has a triage process for one. R2 is closed with
that exception named, not with it hidden.

---

# Phase 2 — Finish the money layer so it can be audited as one thing

The external cryptography audit (R12) is the single largest gate before any
real value moves. It is worth much more if what it reviews is a *complete*
path rather than a promising set of pieces. These rows exist to make the audit
scope a whole system.

### R3 — Retire the transparent payment path · `ready`
`mini-contribution`, `mini-engagement`, `mini-bounty`, `mini-execution` and
`mini-chain` still settle through `mini_settlement::PaymentClaim`, with a
stable payer key, a cleartext amount, and a per-payer `sequence` counter — a
complete public transaction graph.
**Why it blocks:** D-0451 established that if both a transparent and a private
format exist, *choosing* the private one is itself a signal. Until the
transparent path is gone, privacy is opt-in, and opt-in privacy is privacy for
nobody.
**No longer blocked.** R4 shipped the change and fee model these crates
needed and R5 shipped the finality they settle against, so the shielded path
can now do everything the transparent one does. What remains is a migration
decision rather than a missing capability: whether the transparent path is
deleted outright or deprecated first, and what happens to claims already
settled under it. That is a founder call with a D-number, not something to
pick unilaterally while touching five crates' public APIs.
**Closed by:** the five crates settling only through `mini-private-payment`,
with a decision recording what each lost or kept.

### R4 — Fees, change, and multi-output claims · `done`
A private claim now spends up to 16 inputs and creates up to 16 outputs, and
proves `Σ inputs = Σ outputs + fee` without opening a single amount. Change is
an output paying yourself, built by the same code path as any other, so
nothing on the wire says which output was the payment.
**Why it blocked:** R3 cannot happen without it, and a transparent fee attached
to a shielded payment reintroduces exactly the linkable value the shielded
path removes.
**Closed by:** D-0455 — a two-column MLSAG in `mini-value` binding each
pseudo-output commitment to the ring member the signer actually controls, the
balance check in `mini_private_payment::verify`, and the commitment opening
carried in the sealed memo so a received payment is immediately spendable.
Claim format v2; v1 claims do not decode, because a v1 claim proved no
balance.
**What it did not close:** the fee is public, and so are a claim's input and
output counts — each is a fingerprint, stated in the crate docs rather than
papered over. What a fee *should be*, and who collects it, is an economics
decision this makes possible and does not make. The construction is standard
RingCT; this implementation of it is still unaudited and still gated behind
R12.

### R5 — Chain-backed private ledger view · `done`
`PrivateLedgerView` had one implementation — a test double that finalized
whatever it was told to — so no private payment could reach `Finalized` on
anything but its say-so. The chain now finalizes shielded spends and
`reconcile` reads real canonical state.
**Closed by:** D-0457. `mini-execution` finalizes opaque
`(key_image, claim_digest)` records with the transparent path's own
first-wins/M3 discipline, all-or-nothing per claim; `mini-private-payment`'s
`ChainBackedPrivateLedger` adapts any key-image lookup into a
`PrivateLedgerView`. The two crates deliberately do **not** depend on each
other: that edge would have been the first path in this tree from a value
crate to the crate that counts votes (P1, Directive 16).
**What it did not close:** the chain finalizes a key image on a proposer's
say-so. It cannot check that a valid claim produced one — that is the
cryptography it deliberately cannot see — so a Byzantine proposer can burn
an output that is not theirs. The *ordering* is real; the ledger's
*contents* are not yet trustworthy. That validity rule is R8's.

### R6 — Amount disclosure for accounts that choose it · `done`
A view key made income enumerable and left it un-addable. An account can now
publish `(amount, blinding)` openings for chosen outputs, and anyone
recomputes the commitment to check them.
**Closed by:** D-0458. `AmountDisclosure` plus `audit_amounts`, which returns
`AuditedIncome` — the opened total **beside** the count of recognized
payments left unopened — rather than a bare number. Openings are chosen and
no cryptography can force the choice, so a sum reported without that count
would quietly mean "the part they decided to show". Recognition comes from
the view key, so the auditor learns the payment count from cryptography
rather than from the discloser's cooperation, which is what makes a withheld
opening visible.
**What it did not close:** completeness in the direction that matters. A
disclosure covers one account and nothing proves it is the only one its
holder controls. An audit still sees income only — never a balance.

### R7 — Decoy weights fitted to real traffic · `blocked`
`AGE_WEIGHTS` (D-0449) is a legible starting shape, not a distribution fitted
to measured spend ages, because no such traffic exists yet. `MIN_RING_SIZE`
should be revisited on the same evidence.
**Blocked by:** R17 — there is no traffic to fit until something real runs.

---

# Phase 3 — Make the network a network

### R8 — Consensus production gaps · `active`
The consensus slices are tested protocol work, not a production network. Four
named gaps: no state sync for a node that missed a whole height; no slashing
layer; peers are supplied rather than discovered; and `mini_bearer::Channel`'s
handshake is anonymous, so it proves nothing about *which* validator is on the
other end.
**Why it blocks:** each is a liveness or accountability hole that only appears
under real adversarial load.
**The accountability gap is closed by D-0460.** A validator that signs two
conflicting votes at one `(phase, height, round)` now convicts itself:
`EquivocationProof` carries both votes, anyone can check it, and
`ValidatorSet::excluding` computes the set without the offender. The sanction
is exclusion, never an economic penalty — Mininet has no stake, and a penalty
denominated in value would make validator behaviour a function of wealth in
exactly the direction P1 and Directive 16 forbid. **What that did not
close:** nothing *detects* equivocation without vote gossip, nothing ejects
automatically (adopting an exclusion is a governance action, or fabricating a
removal becomes the attack), and only double-voting is covered — silence,
censorship and invalid proposals are not self-proving in the same way.
**The peer-discovery gap is closed by D-0462.**
`mini-consensus::discovery::pex_over_tcp`/`serve_pex_over_tcp` carry
`mini-net`'s already-tested PEX logic over the same anonymous, encrypted
`mini_bearer::Channel` handshake `catch_up_over_tcp`/`state_sync_over_tcp`
already use, so a node can learn peers it was never handed, with no
directory server.
**The validator-authenticated-handshake gap is closed by D-0463.**
`mini_consensus::validator_channel` lets a validator device sign
`mini_bearer::Channel::channel_binding` with an already-delegated,
`VOTE`-capable key — the same construction `mini-presence` already uses for
device co-presence, no new cryptography — so a caller can learn *which*
validator is on the other end of an already-established channel.
**The state-sync gap was already substantially closed by D-0207's**
catch-up/state-sync primitives: QC-bound exact execution snapshots, a local
journaled archive, bounded recent history, and encrypted snapshot-plus-suffix
transfer.
**What none of the four automatically does:** none of D-0207/D-0460/D-0462/
D-0463 is wired into `net::TcpMesh::establish` itself. That constructor's
deadlock-free dial/accept convention still needs one consistent,
fully-resolved address list every node agrees on up front, and its links
stay anonymous by their own existing, documented design (consensus messages
already self-identify at the payload level). All four are real, tested,
callable primitives a caller reaches for — a validator-authenticated link,
a discovered peer set, a caught-up node, an excluded equivocator — not
capabilities the mesh performs on its own. Turning any of them into the
mesh's default behavior (identity-gated admission, dynamic topology,
automatic catch-up on startup, automatic exclusion adoption) is separate,
later, host/deployment-level work — named here rather than hidden.
**All four originally named gaps now have a shipped, tested answer** — the
tests each of D-0207/D-0460/D-0462/D-0463 shipped with, each failing without
its fix. **The shielded-spend validity gap named by D-0457 is now closed by
D-0474.** Today's chain finalized a key image on a proposer's say-so with no
check that a valid claim produced it — that check is the cryptography
`mini-chain`/`mini-execution` deliberately cannot see (see
`mini_execution::nullifier`'s module docs). D-0457 named two directions: a
succinct proof, or a validator set that verifies claims and is measured for
it. D-0474 built the second: `mini_execution::ClaimVerifier`, a caller-
injected trait threaded through `apply_block_with_verifier`/
`apply_finalized_block_with_verifier` and `mini_consensus::ConsensusNode`'s
new `with_claim_verifier`, gating a validator's own live proposal
validation, proposal building, and commit — `None` reproduces the pre-
D-0474 trust-the-proposer behavior exactly, so every existing caller is
unaffected. New crate `mini-shielded-verify` composes it with
`mini_private_payment::verify` without `mini-execution`/`mini-consensus`/
`mini-chain` ever gaining a dependency on `mini-value` — the wall in
`docs/design/private-payment-path.md` §13's own diagram holds unchanged.
**What that did not close, stated plainly:** no claim-evidence gossip
protocol (how full claim bytes reach a validator is a separate, unbuilt
piece), no accountability trail recording *which* validators actually ran
verification (the "measured for it" half of D-0457's own phrase — an
evidence trail analogous to `mini-consensus::evidence`'s equivocation
proofs), and the succinct-proof alternative direction remains entirely
unbuilt. **Closed by:** those three remaining pieces, none of which is this
row's last blocker any longer — the validity rule itself, which was the
row's own stated last-open item, now exists and is tested.

### R9 — KEL freshness and witnesses (M3) · `active`
The stale-KEL revocation gap, audit #12 finding F4. A device whose delegation
was revoked can still be accepted by a peer holding an old key event log.
**Why it blocks:** it is a live identity-security hole, not a design question —
revocation that does not propagate is revocation in name only.
**Progress:** `FreshnessPins` (D-0088) closes the replay case for a verifier
that has seen the identity before. Phases 1-3 of
[`docs/design/kel-witness-receipts-and-duplicity-gossip.md`](design/kel-witness-receipts-and-duplicity-gossip.md)
built the receipt types, the witness state machine, duplicity proofs and
`KelAssurance`. **D-0459** closed the hole that made every level above
`Pinned` decorative: the `WitnessPolicy` was caller-supplied, so an attacker
could name witnesses they controlled and earn the strongest assurance level
for a forged branch. It now comes from the identity's own signed KEL.
**More progress:** **D-0464** ships Phase 4's typed receipt-collection
protocol (`did-mini::witness_protocol`) — pure request/response messages
and handlers, no network yet — and extends D-0459's fix to the signing
side: `WitnessJournal::observe_declared` reads the policy from a
submitted KEL's own history rather than accepting one as a parameter, so
`SubmitEventForWitnessingRequest` has no field a forged policy could live
in. **D-0465** ships Phase 6: new crate `mini-witness-service`'s
`PersistentWitnessJournal` gives `WitnessJournal` durable,
crash-recoverable state by replaying accepted observations through
`WitnessJournal::observe_declared` on open, plus an identity-count quota.
**D-0466** ships Phase 5's first slice: `did-mini::gossip`'s
`KelHeadSummary` (a compact, unsigned claim about an identity's current
head) and `compare_head_summaries` (a pure `Agrees`/`Disagreement`/
`Ahead`/`Behind` classification) — resolving a disagreement reuses
D-0464's existing receipt-collection protocol rather than adding a new
fetch type. **D-0467 closes Phase 5's second half and the phase itself:**
`mini_sync::gossip_summary_carrier` wraps a `KelHeadSummary` as an
ordinary object riding the existing MINI/SYNC1 sync protocol — zero new
wire messages — and `compare_gossip_carrier` compares an ingested one
against the receiver's own `KelCache`.
**D-0468** ships Phase 7's first slice: `did-mini::witness_rotation`'s
`WitnessJournal::certify_policy_transition` lets a witness certify, under
its own *old* retained policy generation, that a witness-set-changing
rotation is legitimate — closing the hole where a compromised controller
could otherwise drop every honest witness in one unwitnessed, self-signed
rotation. `verify_policy_transition` checks a threshold of such receipts
against the old policy, reusing Phase 1's `WitnessedEventCertificate`
unchanged.
**D-0471 closes Phase 7's second slice (§17.3):** `verify_witness_rotation`
AND-composes that same old-policy check with a new-policy readiness
threshold — enough new witnesses' own ordinary first receipts for the
same rotation event, checked the same unchanged way. No new receipt type:
a new witness's first observation already signs under the new generation,
so existing Phase 1-4 machinery already produces what §17.3 needs.
**D-0475 closes Phase 7's last slice (§17.4) and the phase itself:**
`verify_dead_witness_recovery` is the deliberately opposite case from
§17.2/§17.3 — it works *without* old-witness cooperation, so a witness
set that has gone permanently dark can never hold an identity hostage.
The controller self-signs a typed `WitnessUnavailabilityAttestation`
while its pre-rotation keys are still current, documenting a
minimum-length unreachability window for a named old witness; the
verifier checks that signature against exactly that prior key state,
requires a caller-set minimum number of distinct attested-unreachable
witnesses, and — unless the recovery retires witnessing outright — still
requires the successor policy's own readiness certificate exactly as
§17.3 already does. This is accountability, not unforgeability, and says
so plainly: nothing can cryptographically prove a third party is
unreachable from outside that party's own cooperation, so the honest
tradeoff is a durable, non-repudiable, historically-anchored controller
claim rather than a stronger guarantee this codebase cannot actually
make. **Remaining:** a real call site that *gates* an authority decision
on an assurance level, and any dispute-resolution consequence for a
controller found to have attested falsely — both founder-facing policy
calls, not engineering choices this phase can make for them.

### R10 — BLE and local-radio transport · `outside`
Needs real phone hardware and Kotlin radio wiring. The BLE-first bootstrap
story is central to the "works without infrastructure" claim and is currently
unproven on any physical device.
**Closed by:** the T1–T6 matrix in `docs/gates/hardware-test-protocol.md` run
on real hardware (#97).

### R11 — A client application people can actually use · `ready`
`mini-keystone`'s two-device demo exists, but two physical devices have not
completed the full acceptance path, and the encrypted keystone/range/reward
path is still separate.
**Why it blocks:** a protocol nobody can run is not a released network.
**Closed by:** the acceptance path completed on two real devices, end to end.

---

# Phase 4 — The gates code cannot close

These are the reason there is no date. Each is tracked in
[#99](../../issues/99) with a scope package under [`docs/gates/`](gates/).
**A passing test suite, a founder review, and an AI review do not close any of
them.**

### R12 — External cryptography audit · `outside`
Scope: `mini-value`, `mini-treasury`, `mini-settlement`, `mini-bounty`, and now
`mini-private-payment`. Three founder-overridden AI-authored prototype
constructions (stealth addresses, ring signatures, Bulletproofs) compose into
one object, plus a protocol decoy-sampling rule and a disclosure path.
**Why it blocks:** it gates everything value-bearing (D-0047). A privacy
failure does not announce itself — it produces payments that look private and
are not.
**Closed by:** a real applied-cryptography auditor engaged and signed off
(#72, `docs/gates/crypto-audit-scope.md`). Founder action, at day 0.

### R13 — FROST DKG audit · `outside`
The DKG and resharing are implemented and tested (D-0059/D-0060); the audit is
not done. A DKG bug can permanently expose treasury and bridge keys — not one
transaction, the keys themselves.
**Closed by:** #93, `docs/gates/dkg-audit-scope.md`. Founder action, at day 0.

### R14 — Legal counsel review · `outside`
Contribution rails and treasury, before either touches real funds.
**Closed by:** #96, `docs/gates/legal-review-brief.md`. Founder action, at day 0.

### R15 — Sybil resistance and personhood · `outside`
**The sharpest open question in the project** (#18, #21). Everything today
counts identity roots. An identity root is not a verified human, and nothing
in this repository may ever be described as "one human, one vote" until
SPEC-02 personhood actually lands.
**Why it blocks:** equal-weight-per-root governance is only meaningful if roots
are scarce. Today they are not.
**Closed by:** funded research on the tracks named in D-0075 —
private TLS predicates, sensor provenance, blind uniqueness credentials,
private co-presence diversity, coercion modeling. This is open research, not
engineering debt.

### R16 — Tokenomics validation · `outside`
D-0073/D-0074 are decided and a 576-scenario simulation harness has been run,
but calibration authority is not something this repository can hold.
**Closed by:** a mechanism-design specialist validating the calibration
(#47, #50).

---

# Phase 5 — Release engineering

### R17 — Adversarial testing at real-world scale · `blocked`
**Blocked by:** R8, R11.
Everything above is tested against fixtures and local processes. Nothing has
faced a hostile internet.
**Closed by:** a sustained public test network with results published, however
unflattering.

### R18 — Genesis, validator set, and activation · `blocked`
**Blocked by:** R8, R12.
Nobody has chosen genesis, the initial validator set, activation time, or
release state. D-0443 deliberately left all four out of scope.
**Closed by:** a founder decision recorded as a D-number, with the reasoning
public.

### R19 — Release, install, and rollback on real targets · `ready`
The spine exists end to end (D-0066 Batches 1–5) and
`tools/no_github_outage_demo.sh` proves the lifecycle with GitHub never named.
What has not happened is that path running on real target machines, repeatedly,
including a deliberately broken release rolling itself back.
**Closed by:** the Debian appliance profile (D-0446) exercised on real
hardware, with the rollback path proven under failure.

### R20 — The honest launch statement · `blocked`
**Blocked by:** R12, R13, R14, R15, R16, R17, R18 — every gate whose outcome
the statement has to report. It is written last on purpose: it is an account
of what actually happened, not a plan.
Before release, one document states plainly what is proven, what is audited by
whom, what is still assumed, and what a user is trusting when they install
this. Every "not built", "not audited", "not anonymous" statement in the tree
gets re-checked against reality on that day.
**Why it matters:** the entire project is a bet that honesty is a feature. The
launch statement is where that bet is settled.

---

## What is deliberately *not* on this list

- **Extreme-environment and DTN operation** (#28) — real domain expertise
  needed, explicitly not launch-blocking.
- **Local Wi-Fi data bearer** (#98) — connectivity, not a security signal;
  lower urgency than R10.
- **Automatic recruitment, contributor directories, working-group
  delegations** — coordination conveniences, not release requirements.
- **Anything that would weaken a frozen invariant to ship sooner.** There is
  no row for that and there never will be. If a gate cannot be closed
  honestly, the answer is that the network is not ready, not that the
  invariant was too strict.
